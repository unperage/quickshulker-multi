 * container closes the current one as usual, and that level is re-opened once the new one is gone. Every level is
 * a {@link ChestMenu} over some {@link Container}, which covers chests, ender chests and quick-opened shulkers
 * alike. The container itself is what survives, so entering a level again never loses its contents.
