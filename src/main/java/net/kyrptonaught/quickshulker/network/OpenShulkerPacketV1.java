 * <p>
 * A newer client sends {@link OpenShulkerPacket}, which carries an extra boolean, under its own channel id. The
 * two must not share an id: a client still running an older build would send four bytes, the newer codec would
 * read a boolean past the end of the buffer, and the connection dies with a DecoderException - which is what
 * kicked every player who was not on the matching build.
