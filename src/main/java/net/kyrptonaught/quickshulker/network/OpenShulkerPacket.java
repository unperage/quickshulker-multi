/**
 * @param invSlot    the menu slot to open, negative for a slot that lives in another container
 * @param nest       whether the client wants this open to be stacked, so closing it returns to the previous screen.
 *                   The setting lives on the client, so it has to travel with the request - the server cannot read it.
 * @param fromScreen whether the request was made while a screen was open (inventory, creative inventory, another
 *                   container) rather than from the world with the item in hand. The server cannot tell these apart:
 *                   {@code player.containerMenu} is the InventoryMenu in both cases, because that is what the server
 *                   keeps for a player who is walking around. Only the client knows whether the mouse was over a slot
 *                   on an open screen. Without this flag, closing a container opened from the world would return to
 *                   the inventory instead of the game, and closing one opened from the inventory would drop straight
 *                   out to the game.
